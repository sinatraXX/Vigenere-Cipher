# ✨ Vigenere-Cipher ✨
## 📎 Subject: Network Cryptography
### 📖 Project Backstory
Along with [Affine Cipher](https://github.com/sinatraXX/Affine-Cipher), this program is also a part of my final project. We were asked to create a simple encryption program as well as a cracking program and made [documentations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJ0n9NELsnuXXV9H4clOYJj2oYttAbeD/view) on it.
### 📝 How to use
Basically you can use this program like any other simple python program. No inputs necessary. You can also change your desired plaintext/ciphertext inside the program. Make sure to have the modules needed in the same directory in order to make the cracking program works.
